This part contains the comprehensive test suite that was used to validate the ML Stack installation and integration processes. These tests have been archived after successful validation.

## Contents

The following test scripts are archived here:

- `test_env_consistency.sh` - Tests environment consistency across installations
- `test_package_manager_integration.sh` - Tests package manager integration
- `test_venv_compatibility.sh` - Tests virtual environment compatibility
- `test_rocm_detection.sh` - Tests ROCm GPU detection and configuration
- `test_dependency_conflicts.sh` - Tests for dependency conflicts
- `test_installation_order.sh` - Tests installation order dependencies
- `test_config_integration.sh` - Tests configuration integration
- `test_error_recovery.sh` - Tests error recovery mechanisms
- `test_comprehensive_integration.sh` - Comprehensive integration tests
- `enhanced_verify_installation.sh` - Enhanced installation verification
- `custom_verify_installation.sh` - Custom verification procedures

## Purpose

These scripts were used to:
- Validate the complete ML Stack installation process
- Test component integrations and dependencies
- Verify ROCm and AMD GPU compatibility
- Ensure error recovery and robustness
- Validate package management and virtual environments

## Usage Notes

- These scripts are archived but can be restored to the `scripts/` directory for regression testing
- Each script focuses on specific aspects of the installation and runtime validation
- Refer to the main project documentation for current testing procedures

## Status

Archived after successful validation of the ML Stack installation process.
