# Part 9: Virtual Environments (Archived)

This part contains virtual environment directories that were used during development and testing of the ML Stack project. These environments have been archived after successful use and validation.

## Contents

The following virtual environments are archived here:

- `onnxruntime_rocm_venv/` - Virtual environment for ONNX Runtime with ROCm support
- `pytorch_rocm_venv/` - Virtual environment for PyTorch with ROCm support

## Purpose

These virtual environments were used to:
- Isolate testing of specific ML components
- Maintain separate environments for different build configurations
- Preserve working environments for future reference or debugging

## Current Status

- Virtual environment directories have been successfully archived
- Both specified environments are present in this archive part
- Original locations have been cleaned up to avoid duplication

## Usage Notes

- Virtual environments are typically large and contain many files
- They are archived separately to avoid cluttering the main codebase
- If needed, environments can be recreated using the installation scripts
- Current environment management is handled through the main installation process

## Status

Archived after successful validation and integration into the main installation process.
