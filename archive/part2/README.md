# Part 2: Build Scripts (Archive After Use)

This part contains build scripts that were used during the development and testing phases of the ML Stack project. These scripts have been archived after successful use and validation.

## Contents

The following build scripts are archived here:

- `build_flash_attn_amd.sh` - Main build script for Flash Attention AMD
- `build_flash_attn_amd_part1.sh` - Part 1 of Flash Attention AMD build process
- `build_flash_attn_amd_part2.sh` - Part 2 of Flash Attention AMD build process
- `build_flash_attn_amd_part3.sh` - Part 3 of Flash Attention AMD build process
- `build_onnxruntime.sh` - Main build script for ONNX Runtime
- `build_onnxruntime_part1.sh` - Part 1 of ONNX Runtime build process
- `build_onnxruntime_part2.sh` - Part 2 of ONNX Runtime build process
- `build_onnxruntime_part3.sh` - Part 3 of ONNX Runtime build process
- `build_flash_attn_amd_outline.sh` - Outline/documentation for Flash Attention AMD build

## Purpose

These scripts were used to:
- Build and compile Flash Attention components optimized for AMD GPUs
- Build ONNX Runtime with ROCm support
- Handle multi-part build processes for complex components

## Usage Notes

- These scripts are archived but can be restored to the `scripts/` directory if rebuilding is needed
- Each script contains specific build instructions and dependencies
- Refer to the main project documentation for current build procedures

## Status

Archived after successful validation and integration into the main installation process.
